Frustrated by the lack of free, open-source scientific calculators that feel like the ones I am used to, I decided to reverse-engineer my old calculator from school.

With features like:

- input of complex equations,

- output as fractions as well as decimals,

- result storage and reuse,

- selection and editing of equations from input history,

- and support for implicit multiplication (like 5Ï€ instead of 5*Ï€),

this calculator produces math that looks like the math on your paper. That makes it much more suitable for higher-level math in school and universityâ€”especially if you've grown accustomed to this kind of interface from a young age and just forgot your calculator at home.

Some additional features include:

- A well-established open-source math.js library as the math engineâ€”so youâ€™re not relying on some sketchy, hand-rolled math logic (just my sketchy hand-rolled input method ðŸ˜›)

- A familiar, intuitive design

- 100% offline usability and fully open source

- Written entirely in HTML, JS, and CSS, which means:

	+ inherently cross-platform (a Flatpak release is planned)

	+ easy for other web developers to contribute

	+ admittedly a bit heavy for a calculator. If you're interested in helping make a lighter version (Flutter, Kotlin, etc.), you're very welcome!
