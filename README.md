# SCHULRECHNER

This is the repository for the Schulrechner App.
You can get the APK directly from the [releases](https://github.com/CardiJey/schulrechner/releases/latest/) or from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.cardijey.schulrechner). You can also install the Linux-desktop version from [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.CardiJey.schulrechner)
Alternatively you can build it yourself by installing [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and then running the steps in the [Github CI](https://github.com/CardiJey/schulrechner/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml).

For contributing new calculator designs please read the following:

### Adding New GUI Designs

This project supports multiple GUI designs, which can be switched dynamically.

To add a new GUI design:

1. **Create your SVG file**  
   - Design your GUI as an SVG file, ensuring it meets the following requirements:  
     - Use proper element labels (via the `inkscape:label` property) matching the keys found in `www/img/gui/Classic_by_Joris Yidong Scholl.svg`.  
     - Include polygon elements named `display_input` and `display_output`.  
     - Include elements `scroll_x_order` and `scroll_y_border` to define scrolling behavior.  
     - For each key element (`key_*`), include a corresponding `label_background_*` element for button press animations (these are handled by CSS).  
     - Optionally, add locale-specific labels by appending locale codes like `label_,de-DE` or `label,_en-US`. Only `de-DE` and `en-US` are supported for now.  
   - Add SVG metadata specifying **author**, **date**, and an **open-source license** (e.g., CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA) for compatibility with this GPL3 project.

2. **Create your JSON file**  
   - There are some additional settings needed for a working calculator design
   - Please take a look at `www/img/gui/Classic_by_Joris Yidong Scholl.json` to see what these are

3. **Create a pull request to add your SVG file to the repository**  
   - Place your GUI SVG and JSON in the `www/img/gui/` folder in a pull request. They should be named "Design Name\_by\_Author Name.svg" and ".json"

4. **I'll come test it then and we'll fix any possible errors together**
